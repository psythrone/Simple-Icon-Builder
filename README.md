# Simple-Icon-Builder
A simple tool to convert images to windows icons.
## A simple tool to create icon files
Creates icons 32-bit bitmap format and supports images that are 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 and 128px.

Just drag and drop the images you want as part of your icon, if the image dropped isn't one of the supported sizes a cropping window will open.

I wrote this program to learn more about the .ico format and not to have to go searching for the old paint.net addon that lets you save images as icons every time I reinstall windows.

If you want to know more about the .ico format I worte down what I found in format.txt.
